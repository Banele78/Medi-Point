Medi-point is a web-based system created to aid people in creating medical  appointments and reducing the waiting period for patients who need treatment and/or consultation. 
It aims at reducing the overwhelming in-patient walk-ins and aids more attention  to admitted patients in hospitals.

In the application the user will be able to search the service they require and get advice on how to treat it, if they cannot treat it by themselves the user can opt to search 
for the nearest medical institution that has the service they looking for.

The application should give real time data to the users for example if one of the medical institution is closed for the day, the medical institution can update that they are closed for the 
day or fuuly booked.

We planning on adding blockchain to the system.
